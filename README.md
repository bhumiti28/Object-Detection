# Object-Detection

Object detection is the task of detecting and identifying semantic objects from a set of classes as captured from an image or a video stream. Training newer models for solving the object detection and classification problem of a particular domain is difficult due to the computational complexity and the time it takes in training a new model. Transfer learning is the process of making use of a pre trained model for training the dataset used in the current domain. 

In this project, we have made use of Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN region proposal based pre trained deep neural networks to improve the object detection over customised datasets. The Mask R-CNN used by us detects images with a minimum 98 percent confidence. 

Making use of the transfer learning approach for training the dataset using these pre trained networks not only reduces the computationally complexity and saves time, but also improves the results of object detection.
